kubernetes:

	- using minikube to set up a single node cluster
	- installed:
			- minikube
			- kubectl
			- docker
			- hyperkit

	- made hyperkit default minkube driver with - 'minikube config set driver hyperkit'
	- pointed docker to the docker daemon inside minikube VM - 'minikube docker-env' and run last line

	- to get a shell to a container in a pod - 'kubectl exec -it <pod> -c <container> -- /bin/sh'

nginx:

	- to start server - 'nginx'
	- to reload or stop - 'usr/sbin/nginx -s reload'
	- could make a user 'www' and use this, but seems that don't have top
	- the file etc/nginx/nginx.conf is read first, and by default redirects to conf.d/*.conf
	  for hosts
	- can either change this nginx.conf file to have server settings, or change those inside conf.d
	- for now have just changed nginx.conf
